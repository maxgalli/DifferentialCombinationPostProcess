# Differential Combination Post Process

I create this repo because I'm sick and tired of having to work in an environment with Python 2 for the [Run2 Combination](https://github.com/maxgalli/DifferentialCombination). The idea is thus to handle all the Combine business in the other repo and use this package for the post processing part (producing the actual results).
